Overview:

The VCS (Volunteer Car Scheme) is a web application to support the running of a volunteer car scheme. The app is intended to make is easier for drivers, customers and the coordinator to use the service. Customers and drivers apply to use the service and the coordinator then approves or denies this application. A registered customer can then submit a trip request and a registered driver can accept or decline a trip request. The coordinator can also request a trip for customers wanting to book over the phone or email. The coordinator can also manage the details of the users and trips.
